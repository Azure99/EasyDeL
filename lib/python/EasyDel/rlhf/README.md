# Attention ðŸ§¬

The `RLHF` Process is not fully supported for right now, and it's still under heavy development
but im trying my best to make it works as good as possible but for now only these
models are supported for ```RLHF```

1. **_Llama_**
2. **_Llama2_**
3. **_Mpt_**
4. **_Falcon_**
5. **_All Other Models supported in library can be used, but they are not tested yet_**

and im trying to make a tutorial for that to how to use `RLHF` in order to train
your models
