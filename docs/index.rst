- **Community-Driven Development**: Share your custom implementations and improvements with the community, fostering a collaborative environment for advancing ML research and development.

With EasyDeL, you're not constrained by rigid frameworks. Instead, you have a flexible, powerful toolkit that adapts to your needs, no matter how unique or specialized they may be.

Advanced Customization and Optimization üîß
==========================================

EasyDeL provides unparalleled flexibility in customizing and optimizing your models:

- **Sharding Strategies**: Easily customize and experiment with different sharding strategies to optimize performance across multiple devices.
- **Algorithm Customization**: Modify and fine-tune algorithms to suit your specific needs and hardware configurations.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Choose from over 10 types of attention mechanisms optimized for GPU/TPU/CPU, including:
  - Flash Attention 2 (CPU(*XLA*), GPU(*Triton*), TPU(*Pallas*)) 
  - Blockwise Attention (CPU, GPU, TPU | *Pallas*-*Jax*)
  - Ring Attention (CPU, GPU, TPU | *Pallas*-*Jax*)
  - Splash Attention (TPU | *Pallas*)
  - SDPA (CPU(*XLA*), GPU(*CUDA*), TPU(*XLA*)) 

This level of customization allows you to squeeze every ounce of performance from your hardware while tailoring the model behavior to your exact requirements.
