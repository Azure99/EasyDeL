"""Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer module for EasyDeL.

This module provides comprehensive supervised fine-tuning capabilities for
language models, enabling adaptation of pre-trained models to specific tasks
and domains through supervised learning on labeled datasets.

The module includes:
- SFTConfig: Configuration class for supervised fine-tuning parameters
- SFTTrainer: Main trainer class implementing supervised fine-tuning
- Support for various training strategies and optimizations
- Integration with instruction tuning and conversational datasets

Key Features:
- Standard cross-entropy loss for next-token prediction
- Support for instruction-following and conversational formats
- Packing of multiple sequences for efficient training
- Response template masking for instruction tuning
- Gradient accumulation and mixed precision training
- LoRA and QLoRA support for parameter-efficient fine-tuning
- Integration with JAX/Flax for distributed training

Example:
    >>> from easydel.trainers import SFTConfig, SFTTrainer
    >>> config = SFTConfig(
    ...     max_sequence_length=2048,
    ...     learning_rate=2e-5,
    ...     packing=True,
    ...     num_train_epochs=3
    ... )
    >>> trainer = SFTTrainer(
    ...     arguments=config,
    ...     model=model,
    ...     processing_class=tokenizer,
    ...     train_dataset=dataset,
    ...     formatting_func=format_instruction
    ... )
    >>> trainer.train()

Use Cases:
- Instruction tuning for following user commands
- Domain adaptation for specialized tasks
- Conversational model fine-tuning
- Task-specific model specialization
- Continued pre-training on domain data
